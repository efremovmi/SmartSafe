# Electronic lock for a safe with multi-factor authentication

This project is the development of an electronic lock for a safe with the possibility of multi-factor authentication, providing a high level of security and access control.

## Project features
- **Multi-factor authentication**: The lock supports the use of two or more factors to confirm the legitimacy of access, such as password, fingerprint, smart card, voice recognition and other modern methods.

- **Electronic system**: The lock is based on a digital access control system that provides reliability and security against hacking. This is the preferred alternative to traditional mechanical locks.

- **Ease of use**: Users have the opportunity to choose the most convenient authentication factors for them or combine them to gain access to the safe. The interface is easy to use, and the system supports flexibility and individual access settings.

- **Integration and extensibility**: The lock can be integrated with other access control systems, such as video surveillance systems, security systems and smart home systems. Its functionality and capabilities can be expanded with additional modules and integrations.
